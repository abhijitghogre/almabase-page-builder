This was an interview task with a time cap on activity completion. However, I would like to point out few things that I would do in a real world production application.
1. I would most likely need a router to separate pages or logical containers of the application.
2. I would use typescript for type safety.
3. I would set up stricter rules for es-lint/ts-lint for maintaining uniform coding practices across the team.
